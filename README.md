## Introduction

**Parry Pong** is a 2D platformer game developed in Unity. In this game, you play as Clio, who discovers that her idyllic natural life is nothing more than a simulation. Players must navigate through various levels, overcoming obstacles and enemies to collect three coins and unlock the exit. The game features vibrant graphics, engaging animations, and a challenging environment that tests your skills. Can you help Clio escape back to reality?
