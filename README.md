## Introduction

**Parry Pong** is a pixel-art twist on the classic Pong game, developed in Unity. In this competitive 2D arcade game, you control a sword paddle and face off against your opponent, but with a new mechanic: parrying. Using this unique skill, you can either speed up or slow down the ball, adding an extra layer of strategy and intensity to every rally. Parry Pong features custom pixel assets and dynamic, fast-paced gameplay. Hone your reflexes and timing as you master the parry to outmaneuver your opponent and claim victory. Will you control the pace, or be overwhelmed by it?
